# DjangoMatrix

**The one-stop repository for all things Django-related.**

DjangoMatrix is a _community-driven project_ that aims to consolidate important information about Django versions, package compatibilities, and dependencies all in one place. Our goal is to make it easier for developers and users to understand and navigate the ever-evolving ecosystem of Django and its numerous extensions.

## Why DjangoMatrix?

- **Centralized Information**: Forget scrolling through multiple documentation sites or GitHub repos. DjangoMatrix compiles relevant details about packages, their Django compatibility, Python version requirements, and moreâ€”all in a single resource.
  
- **Community-Driven**: We believe in the power of open collaboration. If you have information about a package, want to correct something, or feel certain data is missing, we welcome your contributions!
  
- **Evolving Ecosystem**: Django sees frequent updates and new releases. By building a dedicated compatibility matrix, we help ensure that users can quickly figure out which versions of Django and Python work seamlessly together, along with any quirks or special considerations for popular third-party packages.
