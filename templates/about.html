                <b>Curated Package Listings</b><br/>
                Browse a growing collection of Django packages—from essential utilities to specialized tools—along with
                detailed descriptions, version data, and resource links. Our library keeps expanding, thanks to

                <b>Compatibility Matrix</b><br/>
                Each package page highlights its compatibility with various Django versions so you can quickly confirm
                whether a package works with your project’s setup. This saves you time and reduces the risk of
                dependency issues down the road.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Insightful Metrics</b><br/>
                We provide real-time metrics such as GitHub stars, forks, open issues, and last commit dates—helpful
                at-a-glance indicators of a project’s activity and popularity.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Search & Recommendation</b><br/>
                An intuitive search bar helps you quickly locate packages by name or keyword. DjangoMatrix also
                recommends similar packages based on shared tags, enabling you to discover alternative or complementary
                solutions.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Community Contributions</b><br/>
                Have a Django package you’d like to add or update? DjangoMatrix welcomes user suggestions and edits. All
                you need to do is propose a package or contribute to our open-source repository on GitHub.

        <h4>Example in Action</h4>
        <p>
            A typical package page—like our listing for <b><a href="{% url 'package_details' 'cookiecutter-django' %}">Cookiecutter Django</a> </b> — shows an overview of the project, its latest
        versions, compatibility notes, usage metrics, and links to the repository or documentation. You can also find a
        recommended list of similar packages to explore further.
